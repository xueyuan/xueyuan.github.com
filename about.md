Hi!  I'm Alex Huang.  I've avoided social networking circles most of my life
but it's finally time to do something about it.  I thought I start small
with blogging.

A little bit about myself.  I graduated with a BS degree in Computer Science
from EECS at UC Berkeley and a MS degree from Stanford.  Getting people to
write great software together is my passion in life.  I have long realized
that scalable, resiliant, usable software is never written by one person.  My
goal is to be the foundation that team of developers is built on.

My work life has taken me to big companies and small startups.  I started
with Tandem working in Tandem's Non-Stop Kernel and then spent a short period
of time at Nortel Networks.  I was rather bored and decided to join
startups and have remained in the startup field since.  My startup career
included stints at @Motion (formerly Arabesque Communications), Seven Networks,
AdInfuse, and Cloud.com (formerly VMOps).  Of these startups, three were
acquired: @Motion (by Phone.Com, later known as OpenWave), AdInfuse (by Velti),
and Cloud.Com (by Citrix).

I was among the first developers hired at @Motion, the first developer hired
by AdInfuse, and a founding engineer at Cloud.Com.  I absolutely enjoy the
challenges of being the very first developer at a company.  Learned a bundle
and did a ton.

In my spare time, I love to fly, ski, play short-men's volleyball (umm...that would
be volleyball played by people under 6ft tall), take photographs, do things
with my hands, and just stop thinking.  I guess now it will include some
blogging.

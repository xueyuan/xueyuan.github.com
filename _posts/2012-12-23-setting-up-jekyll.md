Thanks to Rohit who introduced me to Jekyll.  It does take me a long while
to get everything setup on my machine because I use Windows.  I keep running
into problems left and right.  I almost wanted to just run the whole thing 
on my Linux VM.  At last, I finally found this page that explains how to 
setup ruby and gem on windows.  After that it was smooth sailing.  So to setup
Jekyll on Cygwin on Windows, follow these steps.
